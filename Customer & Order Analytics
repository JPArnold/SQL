# Here, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about various customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, price*SUM(Quantity) AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;
 
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Sold, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101%'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price as Average_Spent 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2;
